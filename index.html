Genus: Colocasia; Schott
Family: Araceae
Colocasia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, 
native to southeastern Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Some species are 
widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical and subtropical regions.</pre> 
<pre class="two">  
The names elephant-ear and cocoyam are also used for some other large-leaved genera
in the Araceae, notably Xanthosoma and Caladium. The generic name is 
derived from the ancient Greek word kolokasion, which in Greek, botanist 
Dioscorides (1st century AD) may have inferred the edible roots of both 
Colocasia esculenta and Nelumbo nucifera.
The species Colocasia esculenta is invasive in wetlands along the American Gulf coast, where it threatens to displace native wetland plants.
